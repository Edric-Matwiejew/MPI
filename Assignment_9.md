# Assignment 9

 

For this assignment you will write an MPI program to solve the Laplace equation using Jacobi iteration and the parallel partitioning scheme described in the lecture slides.

 

Part 1 covers the MPI functions and program fragments required to implement the parallel algorithm. In part 2 you are asked to implement the alogorithm and compare it qualitatively to a provided result. Finally, in part three you will transfer your program to the QUISA workstation and examine its parallel performence.

 

 

 

## Part 1 (marks 5)

 

### 1. (a)

 

The program shown below contains two bugs, identify the errors and correct them so the code executes successfully.

 

The program is designed for two MPI processes and should print "[0,0]" from rank 1 on completion.

 

```python

from mpi4py import MPI

import numpy as np

 

COMM = MPI.COMM_WORLD

rank = COMM.Get_rank()

 

if rank == 0:

    send_array = np.array(2*[rank], dtype = np.int)

 

if rank == 0:

    COMM.Send([send_array, MPI.INT], dest = 1)

else:

    COMM.Recv([recv_array, MPI.INT], source = 1)

    print(recv_array)

```

 

### 1. (b)

 

Starting with the following 2-dimensional array at rank 0:

 

```python

n = 3

 

COMM = MPI.COMM_WORLD

 

rank = COMM.Get_rank()

size = COMM.Get_size()

 

if rank == 0:

    A = np.zeros((size*n, size*n), dtype = np.float64)

 

    for i in range(n*size):

        A[i,:] = i

```

 

Write an MPI program that carries our the following steps:

 

1. At rank 0, partition a into `size` row-wise partitions with `n` rows each and store the partitions in a numpy array of dimensions `(size, n, size*n)`.

3. Use Scatter to send an `(n, size*n)` row partion from rank 0 to each process in the communicator. Recieve this partition into an `(n, size*n)` NumPy array `local_array`.

4. At each rank, compute `local_array  += rank`, and print the results using:

 

```python

print(local_array,'\n', flush = True)

```

 

With `n=3` and 3 MPI processes the expected output is:

 

Rank 0:

```

[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]

[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2]]

```

Rank 1:

```

[[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]

[5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]

[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]]

```

Rank:2

```

[[ 8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  8]

[ 9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9]

[10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10]]

```

 

### 1. (b)

 

Adding on to your code from 1 (a), implement a single pass of the communication pattern shown on slide 28 of the Lecture slides. Store incoming values from the 'above' rank in an a NumPy array `upper`, and those coming from a 'below' rank in the NumPy array `lower`.

 

The code below defines `lower` and `upper`, and partitally implements communication of the `upper` values. Use this as a starting point.

 

```python

 

if rank > 0:

    upper = np.empty(size*n, dtype = np.float64)

if rank < size - 1:

    lower = np.empty(size*n, dtype = np.float64)

 

 

if rank == 0:

 

    COMM.Send([local_array[-1,:], MPI.DOUBLE], dest = 1)

 

if rank > 0 and rank < size - 1:

 

    COMM.Recv([upper, MPI.DOUBLE], source = rank - 1)

    COMM.Send([local_array[-1,:], MPI.DOUBLE], dest = rank + 1)

```

 

For each MPI process, at the values of `lower` and `upper` to the rows of `local_array`, as shown below.

 

 

```python

for i in range(local_array.shape[0]):

    local_array[i,:] += lower

    local_array[i,:] += upper

```

 

If only `lower` or `upper` were sent to the MPI process, add them only.

 

Place an barrier (`COMM.Barrier()`) to keep the output of this question seperate from 1 (a) and print `local_array` at each rank using:

 

```python

print(local_array, '\n', flush = True)

```

For `n=3` and 3 MPI processes the expected output is:

 

Rank 0:

```

[[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]

[5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]

[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]]

```

Rank 1:

```

[[14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14]

[15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15]

[16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]]

```

Rank:2

```

[[14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14]

[15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15]

[16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]]

```

 

### 1 (c):

 

Take the average of the all of the elements in the `local_array` and store the averages in an array of length `size` called `averages`. Use `Gather` to collect the averages to `rank=0`.

 

Use the code snippet below to calculate the sum of the averages and then broadcast the sum to each process in `COMM_WORLD`. 

 

```python

if rank == 0:

    average_sum = 0

    for av in averages:

        average_sum += av

else:

    average_sum = None

average_sum = COMM.bcast(average_sum, root = 0)

 

print(average_sum, flush = True)

```

 

Again use a `COMM.Barrier()` to keep this output seperate from the rest of the questions.

 

 

### 1 (d)

 

Use `COMM.Gather` to gather `local_array` to the `rank = 0`. At rank = 0, reshape the the recieved array into a matrix of dimensions `(2, 2)` using the NumPy `reshape` function.

 

### 2 (marks 3):

 

Writes function that performs Jocobi iteration on a 2D array. It should take a 2D array as input, and return the updated array, and the error (epsilon in the slides).

 

Use this 'kernel' in combination with the MPI code written in part 1 to implement a parallel Laplace solver.

 

Solve for a system of `60 x 60` vertices the Laplace equation with initial conditions:

 

```python

m=np.zeros((num_points,num_points),dtype=float)

pi_c=np.pi

x = np.linspace(0,pi_c,num_points)

m[0,:]=np.sin(x)

m[num_points-1,:]=np.sin(x)

```

 

Define array `m` ar `rank = 0` and distribute the array following the method you used in question 1 (b).

 

### 3 (marks 2):

 

Transfer your code to the QUISA workstation. Using the example *.slurm file as a template, run your code on 2, 4, 6, 8 and 16 processes. Time the program wall time using `time`, as shown in the slurm file.

 

Start off with a grid of size `(1000 x 1000)`. If that that takes too long, work down from there.
